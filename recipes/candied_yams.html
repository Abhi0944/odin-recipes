    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>
      Although there's no rule against making candied yams any time you want,
      there are three times a year when candied yam recipes reach their peak
      popularity: Thanksgiving by far leads the way, with Christmas and Easter
      coming in a distant second and third.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, it's safe to say that if you're making candied yams, it's probably for
      a holiday feast. And with all the prep and cooking that goes into the
      holidays, it's no surprise that our Allrecipes home cooks appreciate an
      easy four-ingredient recipe like Candied Yams as a no-fuss side dish to
      round out their special holiday menus.
